It s been a long eight-year wait for United Bank of Africa Uganda, a Nigerian-owned lender, to inch its way into the profit league by posting a modest Ush2.6 billion ($717,535) in 2016 from a net loss of Ush4.3 billion ($1.1 million) in 2015. According to the bank s latest financial statements, income increased from Ush24 billion ($6.5 million) in 2015 to Ush29.7 billion ($8.1 million) in 2016 on the back of interest earnings from government securities and non-funded lines. The small, new banks tactfully acquired some big corporate clients last year and also recapitalised themselves. This helped them service the big funding needs of those clients fairly well while huge investments in government securities also boosted their revenues, said Joram Ongura, a stockbroker at SBG Securities Ltd. Total interest earned from Treasury bills and bonds grew from Ush8.4 billion ($2.2 million) to Ush8.8 billion ($2.4 million) during the period under review as fees and commission income rose from Ush7.7 billion ($2.1 million) in 2015 to Ush10 billion ($2.8 million) in 2016. In contrast, interest from loans and advances grew slightly from Ush3.3 billion ($906,336) in 2015 to Ush3.5 billion ($944,974) in 2016. The bank realised modest gains in its cost control efforts with expenses dipping from Ush26.6 billion ($7.2 million) in 2015 to Ush25.2 billion ($6.9 million) last year. Assets increased from Ush163 billion ($44.4 million) to Ush172.9 billion ($47.1 million) as non-performing loans fell from Ush3.1 billion ($846,565) to Ush2.1 billion ($573,889). But customer deposits declined from Ush120.7 billion ($32.9 million) to Ush86.4 billion ($23.5 million). UBA was the first Nigerian bank to enter the Uganda market in 2008 and built a network of five branches in four years. The heavy establishment costs took their toll, forcing the bank to close some branches recently and shed jobs. Soon after, the UBA Group recapitalised its Uganda operation with $5 million last year. High funding costs constrained efforts to generate profit over the past eight years. Many new banks have registered funding costs within the 17-20 per cent range, usually on fixed deposits, compared with established lenders that incur average lending costs of less than 15 per cent. Ecobank Uganda, a West African peer, also broke even last year after seven years of loss making. The bank recorded a net profit after tax of Ush813 million ($221,295) in 2016 in contrast to a loss of Ush754 million ($205,296) posted in 2015. NIC Bank commenced operations in 2013 and broke even during 2015. It recorded a loss of around Ush300 million ($81,619) in 2013 but posted a smaller loss of Ush20 million ($5,441) in 2014. The bank registered a profit of Ush560 million ($152,357) at the end of 2015. KCB Bank Uganda, the first Kenyan lender to wade into the Ugandan market started operations in 2007 and broke even in 2010.
