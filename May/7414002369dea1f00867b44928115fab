I can t afford ugali, The world s most basic staple. I haven t any food at all Upon my dining table. My spouse is going hungry; My kids are getting thinner. They can t believe we ve haven t got Ugali for our dinner! We ve never eaten truffles Nor guzzled rich champagne, But we ve always had ugali. We re starving, and we re shamed!
