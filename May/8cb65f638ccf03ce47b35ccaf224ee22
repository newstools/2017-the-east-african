The 82 Chibok schoolgirls released by the Nigerian Islamic extremists Boko Haram were Sunday being accommodated at Banki in Borno State, sources revealed. The sources at the Presidency said the girls were to be flown first to Maiduguri, the Borno capital, and not Abuja, the Federal capital. The 82 girls were released to international negotiators who have been working in collaboration with the Federal government for their safe return, since they were kidnapped in April 2014. Military barracks They were released Saturday afternoon. “The girls are now lodged in the military barracks and will be flown to (the Borno state capital) Maiduguri tomorrow (Sunday),” a military told a news agency. A civilian militia member gave an identical account. A pastor, Mr Enoch Mark, whose two daughters were among those kidnapped, said he was told of the release by the Bring Back Our Girls pressure group and an official in Maiduguri. Slave brides He added: “This is good news to us. We have been waiting for this day. We hope the remaining girls will soon be released. Some 276 girls were seized from their dormitories at the Government Girls Secondary School in the remote town of Chibok in Borno State, on the night of April 14, 2014. Fifty-seven managed to escape and Boko Haram leader Abubakar Shekau later threatened to sell the rest as slave brides, vowing they would not be released until militant prisoners were freed from jail.   Conservationists say construction defied a court order halting the project. Regional bloc says its ready for action as reports of ceasefire violations rise.
