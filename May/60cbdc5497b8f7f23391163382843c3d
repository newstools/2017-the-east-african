Kenya's telecommunications firm Safaricom has announced a 27.1 per cent net profit rise to Ksh48.4 billion ($470 million) in the year to March 2017. The net income includes a one-off adjustment of Ksh3.3 billion ($32 million) -- which Safaricom said was a write-back of a legal cost provision that had not materialised. Total revenue crossed the $2 billion mark for the first time to stand at Ksh212.9 billion ($2.07 billion), an 8.8 per cent rise. The revenue growth is backed by a strong performance in mobile money transfer service M-Pesa and data while traditional services like voice remained resilient. M-Pesa revenues grew from Ksh41.5 billion ($403 million) to Ksh55.08 billion ($535 million) while data revenues grew by 38.6 per cent to Ksh29.29 billion ($284 million). Voice service (incoming and outgoing) revenue rose by 2.9 per cent to Ksh93.5 billion ($908 million) while SMS revenue declined by 3.7 per cent to Ksh16.7 billion ($162 million). The Safaricom board has recommended a dividend of Ksh0.97 ($0.01) per share an increase of 27.5 per cent from the previous year. The proposed dividend payout amounts to Ksh38.86 billion ($372 million), which represents 80 per cent of Safaricom's net profit for the year.
