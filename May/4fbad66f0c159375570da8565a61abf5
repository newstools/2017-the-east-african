Tanzania has extradited to the United States a blacklisted drug kingpin Ali Khatib Haji Hassan commonly known as Shkuba along with two others to face charges on illicit narcotic trafficking. Principal Resident Magistrate Cyprian Mkeha issued the order at the Kisutu court in Dar es Salaam last month. The three – Shkuba, Idd Salehe Mfuru and Lwitiko Samson Adam – were handed over to the American authorities on Monday despite a pending appeal against their extradition. When reached for comment, Shkuba’s lawyers termed the move as a violation of the country’s law. “The State is aware that there is an appeal pending before the High Court against the extradition order issued recently. This is totally against the Constitution and other laws,” lawyer Hudson Ndusyepo said. The three had 15 days within which to file an appeal against the extradition. The US blacklisted Shkuba last year, terming him as “a major international drug kingpin who smuggles multi-tonne shipments of heroin and cocaine to Africa, Europe, Asia, and North America via his East Africa-based drug trafficking organisation.” Last month, the US requested Tanzania to extradite the three suspected drug barons to face charges of smuggling heroin and cocaine to America. Security forces in Tanzania have been cracking down on suspected traffickers in an anti-drugs campaign that has been backed by President John Magufuli.
