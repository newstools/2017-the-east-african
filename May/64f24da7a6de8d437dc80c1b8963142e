The Nairobi Securities Exchange (NSE) has now suspended Atlas African Industries from trading at the bourse for a period of 90 days effective May 8. NSE chief executive officer Geoffrey Odundo attributed the decision to the firm s unresolved issues at the London Stock Exchange where it was suspended on October 17 following the resignation of its nominated adviser (Nomad). Atlas suspension at the London bourse was to last until it hired a new Nomad. However, the company in October last year hinted it was uncertain the appointment would be done, adding then that it was focused at listing at another exchange other than the London Alternative Investment Market (AIM).

Atlas said earlier its Nomad, Stifel Nicolaus Europe Limited, resigned because its specialty in the oil and gas industry did not match the company s current principal activity of sports betting. On Friday, Mr Odundo said NSE had continually engaged the company with aim to resolve the issue of non-compliance in the best interests of its shareholders to no avail. The Capital Markets Authority has directed the Exchange to revise the status of Atlas African Industries Limited from a security halt and now suspend trading of the shares for an initial period of 90 days effective 8 May 2017, said Mr Odundo in a statement. He said during the suspension period, NSE will continue to engage the company towards achievement of an orderly resolution of the company s affairs with particular respect and attention to the interests of its shareholders at the Exchange.
