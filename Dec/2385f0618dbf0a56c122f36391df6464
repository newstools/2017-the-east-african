Liberia's Supreme Court has thrown out a request by the governing Unity Party to halt the 26 December presidential run-off election between ex-football star George Weah and Vice-President Joseph Boakai. The party asked for a delay, arguing that the electoral commission had failed to implement an earlier order of the court to clean up the voters roll of irregularities such as the names of people appearing multiple times. The court ruled that the commission acted within the law to set a date for the run-off, and the commission should abide by its earlier ruling to clean up the roll and post it at polling stations before Tuesday's vote. One judge dissented, saying the Unity Party's petition should be upheld because the voters roll had not yet been sorted out. The run-off was called after Mr Weah beat Mr Boakai in the first round in October, but failed to secure an outright majority. The candidate who came third, Charles Brumskine, said the poll was marred by fraud, but failed in a court bid to order a new election which all candidates could contest. Joseph Nyuma Boakai, Liberia's vice president and presidential candidate of Unity Party (UP), is seen at a polling station in Monrovia, Liberia, October 10, 2017.
