The East African Community’s integration would be far ahead of where it is today were it not for frequent governance missteps, say experts. Over-priced elections, violence, inter-country political rivalries and even corruption are said to cause the bloc losses that impact on its efforts. Speaking at the African Economic Conference in Addis Ababa, director of the UNDP Regional Service Centre for Africa Lamin Manneh cited expensive elections as among the factors that eat into the gains made by the region in its economic and political spheres. But Rwanda stands out for the lowest electoral costs per voter in the region. “At a time its neighbours are spending more on elections and unnecessarily increasing their debt burden, Rwanda chose innovation, resulting in a reduction in the cost of elections to about one-third of what they could have been,” he said. Highest national debt Rwanda spent $6.9 million on last year’s presidential elections — about $1 per voter, which is the least in the region. Comparatively, Kenya conducted one of the most expensive presidential elections globally this year despite having the highest national debt in the region. The country spent more than $499 million — or $25.4 per voter. Uganda spent $4 per voter and Tanzania $5.16 in their previous polls, while Burundi spent $1.1. Burundi, which has known uncertainty since 2014 when President Pierre Nkurunziza chose to run for a contentious term in office, was mentioned among countries that registered a decline in overall governance over the past decade. President Nkurunziza won the election, but the country was plunged into violence, resulting in deaths and displacement of people. A number of senior political and government figures have been reported killed in the country while several others have fled into exile. Related stories:
