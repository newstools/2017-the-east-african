Bodies of 13 Somalis believed to have suffocated in the back of a container truck were discovered on Tuesday in a village in central Mozambique. According to the authorities, the bodies were found dumped in a bush some 200 metres from a police station in Cheringoma in Sofala Province. The Mozambican government said investigations are ongoing but did not give any details. A government source quoted in the local O País newspaper said the Somalia nationals were suspected illegal immigrants travelling from the north to south of the country. “They were probably illegal migrants who were being ferried in a container truck and may have died of suffocation. “As soon as the driver realised they were dead, he threw them in the bush,” the source told O País. The southern African country is a major transit route for migrants, used by human traffickers to ferry Somalis and Ethiopians to South Africa. In May, Mozambique deported 24 Ethiopians found with fake visas.
