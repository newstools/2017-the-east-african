Tension remained high in the Uganda parliament on Monday as it prepared to debate the presidential age limit bill. The opposition members alleged the presence of strangers in the Chambers, but Speaker Rebecca Kadaga dismissed them, saying, they were her bodyguards."These are my people. Yes, they are my bodyguards, .... Don’t you want me to have security?" she asked. Ms Kadaga later suspended six MPs from seven sittings of the House.
