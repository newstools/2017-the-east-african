Kenyan retailer Uchumi Supermarkets' chief executive officer, Dr Julius Kipng'etich, has resigned, the company has announced. The struggling retailer, in a statement posted on its Twitter page Wednesday, said it reluctantly accepted his resignation "with effect from 30 November 2017 to pursue personal interests". Chief financial officer, Mr Mohamed Ahmed Mohamed, will act at the CEO as the company seeks to replace for Dr Kipng'etich. “The Board of Directors has commenced the process of identifying a suitably qualified successor to the Chief Executive Officer and will, in due course, unveil the identified successor,” Uchumi said. Two-year contract Dr Kipng’etich, whose two-year contract expired in October, joined the State-owned retailer from regional lender Equity in August 2015 after its former chief executive, Jonathan Ciano, was fired along with three other managers for mismanagement.
