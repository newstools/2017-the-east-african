The South Sudan Chamber of Commerce has challenged regional bloc Igad to stem the flow weapons to the country. Secretary-General Simon Akuei said the Inter-Governmental Authority on Development should do more to hold the South Sudan leaders accountable. “Some people have taken advantage of the illiteracy levels in South Sudan to cheat the youth to take up arms. “I tend to believe that our politicians and leaders seem to care for themselves but not the youth who were killed fighting for them,” Mr Akuei said. He said South Sudanese leaders were lacking the political will to end the violence that started four years ago, adding that the continuation of the war had forced many businesses to close down.
