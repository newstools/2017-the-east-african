Retired army chief Constantino Chiwenga and veteran politician Kembo Mohadi will be sworn in as Zimbabwe’s vice presidents on Thursday, state-run Zimbabwe Broadcasting Corporation said on Wednesday. The pair, appointed by President Emmerson Mnangagwa, were elevated to similar positions in the ruling ZANU-PF party on Saturday. Mr Chiwenga retired from the military this month. His appointment was expected as a reward for leading a de facto coup in November that ended Robert Mugabe’s 37-year rule and brought Mnangagwa to power. It also adds to signs of a consolidation of power for the army since it turned against the 93-year-old Mugabe. President Mnangagwa has appointed several senior military officers to his Cabinet and the ruling party’s top decision-making body, the Politburo. Former general Sibusiso Moyo, who played a prominent role in the military takeover, was made foreign minister while former air force chief Perence Shiri was named minister of agriculture and land affairs. Mr Mnangagwa is under pressure from opposition parties and the public to implement political reforms.
