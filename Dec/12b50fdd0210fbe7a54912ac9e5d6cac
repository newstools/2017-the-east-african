Kenyan Bankers have ruled out uniform provisioning for government securities under the new accounting regulation, International Financial Reporting Standard 9. This is contrary to previous indications that the industry would be guided by a common default rate by the Institute of Certified Public Accountants of Kenya (Icpak). The institute is yet to issue guidelines on the treatment of the government securities, despite having said in September that it would advise on the common default rate to be applied by banks when the new accounting standard takes effect in January. Under the new regulation, banks are required to make provisions for potential government default. “It is unlikely that Icpak will give a guiding rate because it depends on a bank’s individual assessment,” said Kenya Bankers Association chief executive Dr Habil Olaka. “No government ever defaults on domestic debt and so there is no need to provide for such eventuality. However, a more conservative bank may argue that a government might default rather than print money to pay off such debt,” Dr Olaka said.  Under the International Financial Reporting Standard 9, lenders will have to assume that all loans can be defaulted, including by government, and based on the probability of that default, set aside some cash to cushion them in case of actual default.  This is commonly referred to as provision for bad loans. Kenya has not defaulted on its domestic debt obligations. Related stories:
