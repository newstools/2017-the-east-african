Ms Shamail Alnour is being accused of apostasy for her article on the use of condom as a protection against the HIV/Aids scourge. Her article had explained how condoms could help stem the rising cases of HIV/Aids infections in the predominantly Muslim state. The article prompted strong reactions from several of her compatriots who felt that it went against the Islamic values.
