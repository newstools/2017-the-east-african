South Sudan President Salva Kiir has vowed to undertake radical economic reforms to end the country's current economic crisis and improve the people's lives. In a statement read by his deputy, Dr James Wani Igga, and aired by the state radio Wednesday morning, President Kiir said he was aware of the worsening economic crisis, adding that the government was seeking possible answers to the situation. He directed the Chamber of Commerce to reform its trade policies to help address some of the economic challenges. High crime rates President Kiir further acknowledged the other challenges his administration was facing, include political instability and the high crime rates in the capital Juba. South Sudan devalued its currency in 2015, on the advice of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which occasioned the collapse of the economy. The raging civil war between the factions led by the president and his former deputy Riek Machar have added to the woes of the young nation.
