America's Trump administration on Wednesday imposed sanctions against two senior South Sudanese officials and the country’s former army chief in a warning to the government of President Salva Kiir over increasing attacks on civilians in the country’s four-year civil war. The U.S. Treasury Department, in a statement on its website, said it had blacklisted Malek Reuben Riak Rengu, deputy chief of defense for logistics in South Sudan’s army; Paul Malong, former army chief sacked by Kiir in May and put under house arrest; and Minister of Information Michael Makuei Lueth for their roles in destabilizing South Sudan. The measures freeze any assets in the United States belonging to the three men.
