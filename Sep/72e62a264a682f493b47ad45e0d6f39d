Uganda has this past week witnessed the worst clashes ever on the floor of parliament. Legislators from the opposition sought to use physical violence to stop the ruling National Resistance Movement (NRM) party of President Yoweri Museveni from tabling a motion that would amend the Constitution and remove the age limit on the presidency so that the president can run in 2021. After fist and stick fights inside the chamber with plain-clothes security operatives, 24 opposition MPs were ejected from parliament and sent to jail. The opposition MPs were fighting a losing battle, though. To amend the Constitution needs two-thirds of members. Uganda’s parliament has 436 legislators. NRM needs 291 MPs to amend the Constitution, and already, 288 have signed to support the amendment. Ten NRM MPs have refused while 58 independents and five new NRM MPs support the amendment. That brings the total to 351. If one adds the 10 army MPs, NRM has 361 votes. Yet, the opposition MPs are playing right into President Museveni’s hands. He would like the process of amendment to be seen as democratic — as long as any posturing by opposition MPs does not threaten his hold on power. President Museveni knows the opposition are a tiny, though loud, minority. In giving them a chance to express themselves — even violently on the floor of parliament — they legitimise the amendment. It shows the amendment went through a rigorous democratic process. The violent opposition are subjectively his strongest critics, but objectively they are his strategic allies. No scruples President Museveni has no scruples when his power is threatened. He can be brutal and arbitrary. Tolerating these MPs is a calculated act, not a sign of weakness or impotence. In 2006, he sent hooded security men in black T-shirts, armed with automatic weapons, to invade courts and violently re-arrest suspects who had been granted bail. He also sent his party’s youth who invaded courts forcing judges to run for dear life. The judges complained, donors threatened, the media scolded him, but President Museveni remained in office. The violence in Uganda’s parliament has left a dent on President Museveni’s image
