Kenya’s skies will see heightened activity after the government allowed 20 African and European airlines to start direct flights. The Kenya Civil Aviation Authority (KCAA) said it had considered and found the airlines suitable for issuance of immediate licences, which will see Kenya’s airspace enjoy competitive passenger and cargo service. It has since given stakeholders 21 days to submit views on possible impacts of allowing more passenger and cargo aircraft into Kenya’s airspace. Among the changes, the notice said 540 Aviation will operate on the Nairobi-Juba-Dar es Salaam-Entebbe-Zanzibar-Johannesburg routes for both passengers and cargo. East African Air Charters, Exclusive Air Services, Aircraft Business Management, AIMAir, Ventura Aviation, Kasas, Poriny Air Service and Flitestar Academy were also allowed to fly in from African cities.
