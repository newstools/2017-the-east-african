There is a lot of Italian influence on food all over the world. From pizza to pasta, Italian cuisine is noted for its regional diversity. In my quest to find a good Italian meal, I landed at Delizia Italiana, which opened four months ago. Delizia Italiana is a gelato shop located on the second floor of Kigali Heights. It is set on a terrace overlooking the Kigali Convention Centre. The cozy shop has impeccable interior design, evoking a sense of wellbeing through the white themed decor fused with elements of gray and sprinkles of chocolate. The service was quick as my order was taken as soon as I had settled into my seat. Soft lounge music playing in the background set up a relaxed mood. There was a wide selection of specialty gelato (artisanal Italian ice cream) on display — large bowls of the best selection of local fruit flavours. Delizia Italiana’s menu is in Italian with English translations. After skimming through the menu, I settled for a Piadina Crudo, an authentic Romagna sandwich served with salad. Piadina Crudo is a sandwich with Parma ham and Provolone cheese. It is served with a salad of lettuce and tomatoes spritzed with honey. The Parma ham was rather hard, and the bread was a bit too crusty for my liking. Their salad was fresh and the honey served as an ideal accompaniment. I had the banana split for dessert, and I highly recommend it. The sweet dish was made with split bananas, ice cream of my choice, nutella sauce and whipped cream. For those who enjoy their wine, Delizia Italiana is the place for you. The bar has an assortment of Italian wines from Lombardy, Trentino, Piemonte and Tuscany. The restaurant also has a coffee bar where you have access to their their Internet. Delizia Italiana is a lifestyle and social hub too, hosting fashion pop-up shops and other events.
