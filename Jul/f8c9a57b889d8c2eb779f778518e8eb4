Rwanda, Tanzania and Uganda say their stance to phase-out used clothes imports should not result in their ejection from the US preferential trade programme. Senior officials from the three East African Community (EAC) countries, in Washington Thursday, opposed the move by a US trade lobby to restrict their eligibility status for the African Growth and Opportunity Act (Agoa).

Lawrence Bogard, Smart's lawyer, said during Thursday's US government inquiry that the association's member companies would suffer major losses in jobs and revenues if the EAC ban on used-clothing imports is fully implemented.

Top US trade agency had announced last month that Kenya would be spared review of its Agoa eligibility. The decision was said to be based on “recent actions Kenya has taken, including reversing tariff increases, effective July 1, 2017, and committing not to ban imports of used clothing through policy measures that are more trade-restrictive than necessary to protect human health.” But the Smart lawyer argued that Kenya ought to be included in the Agoa eligibility review until Nairobi clarifies its commitments.
