Police in Kenya on Wednesday morning battled suspected Al-Shabaab militants who razed the Pandanguo Police Post in Lamu West at the Coast. The attackers, who struck at 5am (+3GMT), also commandeered the officers’ vehicle and destroyed a communication mast. The fighting was still raging by 10am. "We have enough officers on the ground fighting the attackers, whom we suspect are Al-Shabaab militants,” a senior security officer told the Nation on condition of anonymity, because he is not authorised to brief the media. Casualties “The exchange of fire started since 5.45am till now. We suspect there are casualties, but I am yet to establish.” Coast regional police commander Akello Odhiambo confirmed the incident, saying: "I am yet to get any details. Our team is on the ground now.” According to Pandanguo headman Adan Golja, gunshots were heard coming from the police post at around 5.30am, forcing villagers to run for their lives. Ragtag militia The attack comes barely two weeks after eight people, including four police officers and four pupils, died when a Rapid Border Patrol Unit (RBPU) vehicle they were travelling in ran over a landmine in Ota, Lamu East. The attack was also blamed on the Somalia-based ragtag militia that is said to be based in the expansive Boni Forest. While the militants fighting to establish an Islamic caliphate in Somalia have not been claiming the attacks, police have linked them to their sympathisers.
