East African Community member states have to open the domestic cargo transport business to competition for costs to come down and allow growth of the logistics industry. Ring fencing the domestic cargo transport business to locals only, according to a new study, has led to underutilisation of freight capacity and compromised the competitiveness of the industry. This requires the region to amend or repeal Article 28 of Northern Corridor Transit and Transport Agreement, which restricts foreign registered trucks to transport goods on foreign markets. Uganda, Kenya and Rwanda consented to the 2007 agreement, as they sought to protect the local operators from competition.

However, the study commissioned by Rwanda Private Sector Federation (PSF) and sponsored by Trademark East Africa says the restriction costs Rwanda transporters about Rwf22.7 billion ($27 million) annually. The same restrictions apply to the central corridor, which means Tanzania and Kenya with bigger transit fleet could be losing about $100 million each annually. The study suggested that removing restrictions on cabotage regulation will lead to an increase in operations and may reduce the cost of transport if the savings are transferred to truck and or cargo owners. Liberalisation would create a more competitive domestic haulage sector as well as reduce the overall cost of transport for Rwanda’s imports and exports. Transporting cargo from Kigali to Mombasa costs on average $3,625. READ: Rwanda objects to cargo charges “There is a benefit in easing the restrictions on cabotage. About 11 per cent to 31
