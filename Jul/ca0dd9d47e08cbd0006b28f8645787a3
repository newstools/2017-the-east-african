Painter Karanja Mwenja sketches his ideas and then paints them in bright colours. His current collection consists of his observations of everyday social events presented in a pop-art style. He fills the canvas with multiple overlapping heads that have green, blue, yellow and red eyes. The women with full luscious lips in the painting Lollolipo Club are sucking on lollipops. Mwenja says he got the idea when he noticed that many young women like sweet things. From his time spent watching live band performances, Mwenja was inspired to create Music Makers. It depicts multicoloured musicians with stringy hair that falls over their eyebrows, playing musical instruments and singing. Along the same lines of social life is the painting Love Sips (above). It has several garishly-coloured faces with wide eyes and open mouths, sipping drinks and biting into fruits in a suggestive manner. “It’s about people enjoying drinks and having an easy time,” says Mwenja, who is based in Mombasa. In a type of story retelling, there is a painting with a snake and two faces. This is Mwenja’s interpretation of the biblical Garden of Eden story, where the first humans went wrong. Mwenja’s talent was nurtured in secondary school by his art teacher who taught him how to paint nature, imagined compositions and still life. “He told me that in the future there would be great demand for my art work,” he says. Although he did not have the opportunity to further his studies in art, Mwenja has grown his skills through practice, learning from his mistakes, and exchanging ideas with other artists. Mwenja paints mainly in oils, but also uses acrylics and watercolours, often finishing a painting in just two days. His works are on display at Karen Country Club and Royal Nairobi Golf Club in Nairobi.   Conservationists say construction defied a court order halting the project. Regional bloc says its ready for action as reports of ceasefire violations rise.
