Tanzania is set to establish a well-equipped snow and ice data centre on Mount Kilimanjaro, Africa's highest peak, a senior official said Tuesday. Agnes Kijazi, the Director-General of Tanzania Meteorological Agency (TMA), said having the data centre will help provide answers as to why the ice cap at the peak of Mt Kilimanjaro is melting. About 85 per cent of ice atop Kilimanjaro in 1912 has disappeared, with the remainder forecast to vanish before 2020 according to a 2012 report by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).

"There are many people who link the snow reduction with climate change. But, I'm sure that once the centre is established at the mountain it will be easier to get the reason and the remarkable measures to address the vice." Mrisho Gambo, Arusha Regional Commissioner, commended the move by TMA, saying it will also help promote the country's tourism. "The centre at the mountain will make it a modern park that would provide accurate data on weather and climate in and outside Tanzania," he said.   Conservationists say construction defied a court order halting the project. Regional bloc says its ready for action as reports of ceasefire violations rise.
