The General Assembly voted unanimously on Thursday to give Kenya’s former trade minister, Dr Mukhisa Kituyi a second term following recommendation of the UN Secretary-General António Guterres. Dr Kituyi hopes to lay the foundation for “a more inclusive, equitable and productive” world after he won another four years at the helm of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD). Dr Kituyi, an expert in international economics and diplomacy, began his first term as the UNCTAD secretary- general following an appointment by former UN boss Ban Ki-moon. “This is an opportunity to rally the world and contribute to actions towards achieving the Agenda 2030 and Sustainable Development Goals adopted in Nairobi in September 2015,” Dr Kituyi told the Business Daily via phone. He was referring to UNCTAD’s 14th Conference of global leaders held in Nairobi, the second time in 40 years for Kenya. UNCTAD is a UN agency which seeks to integrate developing states into the global economy through trade and sustainable policies.
