International humanitarian law experts want a special mechanism of compliance with the law of armed conflicts to minimise civilian casualties as Africa experiences a shift from rural to urban-armed conflicts. The call was made during a regional panel of experts on war in cities organised by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) in Kigali. “The level of intensity of combat we are witnessing in Mogadishu or Bamako forces us to double our efforts to increase compliance with international humanitarian law,” said Adama Dieng, the UN Secretary General’s Special Advisor for the prevention of genocide. “We have to think about the next generation and bring common solutions to reduce the impact of urban warfare on civilians,” he added.

According to Joëlle Germanier, outreach advisor in ICRC Geneva, in urban conflicts priority must be on precise weapons as a means of minimising impacts of hostilities on civilian population. “In urban conflicts, it’s not just looking at the impact of throwing one bomb in an area, there are lots of cumulative impacts and military commanders need to assess all these,” she said Some observers however were worried that that lack of advanced intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance capabilities limit many African belligerents from carrying out disciplined operations.
