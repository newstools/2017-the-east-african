Rwanda has raised its revenue target from Meeting, Incentives, Conferencing and Exhibitions (MICE) for this year by 36 per cent after a year that saw the country tie in third position with Kenya and Egypt for the number of meetings hosted in the continent. According to the International Congress and Convention Association’s statistics report for 2016, Rwanda was globally ranked in position 71 alongside Egypt and Kenya, way ahead of Uganda and Tanzania which tied in position 84 and Ethiopia in position 79. Industry players attribute Rwanda’s rapid rise to a robust marketing campaign and the opening of two high end properties: The Carlson Rezidor managed Kigali Convention Centre and the Marriot Hotel in mid-2016.   The Rwanda Development Board (RDB) has set new targets for the segment, raising revenue projections from the $47 earned last year to $64 million in 2017.

She added that the current volume of traffic, suggests that numbers will treble in the coming years and the country just needs to fast track sector development to secure more bids for hosting conferences.

Rwanda has hosted 80 events since 2014, driven by the Rwanda Convention Bureau that was specifically created to promote MICE. Another 20 big events are expected before the end the year, Youth Connect Africa in July; the Africa Travel Association World Tourism Congress and the Kwita Izina gorilla naming ceremony among others.   Ms Akamanzi said the country was off to a good start following its ranking as the third conference dest
