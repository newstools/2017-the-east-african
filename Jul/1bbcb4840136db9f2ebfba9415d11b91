The National Super Alliance (Nasa) has threatened to boycott the August 8 General Election claiming it has evidence of a plot by ruling Jubilee party to use the military and extra ballots to rig the poll. Nasa's presidential contender Raila Odinga claimed military officials held a meeting on the plan at State House Nairobi on Friday morning. Mr Odinga gave journalists a sheet of paper dated July 17 and marked “secret”, saying it was proof of the alleged scheme. The Nation could not immediately establish the authenticity and the source of the document that is replete with jargon and codes. The opposition has on several occasions accused President Uhuru Kenyatta of plotting to rig the poll using the army. But Mr Kenyatta has dismissed the claims, accusing Mr Odinga of looking for scapegoats because “he is not ready” for elections.
