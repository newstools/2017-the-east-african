Nairobi will host the World Health Organisation (WHO's) emergency operation centre that will coordinate response teams for Eastern and Southern Africa. The World Health Emergency Hub is expected to be set up in the country by the end of the year. The decision to set up the hub in Kenya followed a recommendation by the WHO Regional Office for Africa. The centre will act as a sub-regional resource and response hub. Kenya's Health minister, Dr Cleopa Mailu, commended the WHO for the decision and affirmed the country’s commitment and preparedness to handle emergency operations. “We hope that the hub will contribute to capacity building of locals and build linkages for emergency action with local and international partners,” said Dr Mailu. Kenya has been hailed for its efforts in improving healthcare notwithstanding challenges.
