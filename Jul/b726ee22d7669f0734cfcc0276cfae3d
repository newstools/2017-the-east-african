Rwandan civil society will only be able to deploy election observers to half of the sectors in the August 4 presidential polls after suffering a huge funding shortfall. The development could be the most visible indicator yet of the impact of the European Union’s decision not to send observers to the country for the General Election.

Even then, there was no assurance that the revised budget would be fully funded because the national civil society platform only recently received the National Electoral Commission’s accreditation to monitor elections countrywide, a prerequisite for any fundraising activities. Mr Sekanyange said they were still hopeful that member organisations would meet their funding commitments while part of the budget will come in the form of cars and drivers to transport observers to the field. “We plan to use some of the contributions to buy
