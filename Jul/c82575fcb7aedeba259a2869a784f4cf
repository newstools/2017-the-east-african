Burundi's President Pierre Nkurunziza has Thursday morning been welcomed by his Tanzanian counterpart John Magufuli to Kagera in the northwestern region. The Burundian leader is on a one day visit to the East Africa's second largest economy where he is expected to hold bilateral talks with President Magufuli. It is the first time in two years that President Nkurunziza has made a foreign trip since the 2015 failed coup that was staged while he attended an East African Community Summit in the capital Dar es Salaam. The two leaders are meeting at the border town of Ngara where Mr Nkurunziza was greeted with a 21-gun salute and inspected a guard of honour mounted by Tanzania People's Defence Forces (TPDF). President Magufuli is in Ngara as part of his six-day upcountry tour which kicked off Wednesday in Biharamulo, in the northwestern, where he inaugurated the 154km Kagoma-Biharamulo-Lusahunga road connecting the border regions of Kigoma, Geita and Kagera. The regions border Burundi, Rwanda and Uganda.   Conservationists say construction defied a court order halting the project. Regional bloc says its ready for action as reports of ceasefire violations rise.
