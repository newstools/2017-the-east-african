South Sudanese President Salva Kiir has appealed to the African Union and the UN to support the country’s National Dialogue initiative. President Kiir admitted that the young nation was badly divided and risked disintegration. “Our country is politically divided and we must find ways and means to unite and build one nation. The implementation of the peace deal and the national dialogue are the only way forward,” he said. President Kiir made the remarks during the state of nation address even as South Sudan failed to mark its sixth independence anniversary last Sunday due to lack of funds. Kiir said the support from the regional leaders and the international community could play a key role in the success of the dialogue and in bringing lasting peace to the world's youngest state.
