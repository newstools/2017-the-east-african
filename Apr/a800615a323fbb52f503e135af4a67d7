It s three months since Obama left (East Africa s favourite son), And nothing s yet been heard from him About this Other One. I guess we can imagine, though, What Obama thinks of Trump, As the contrast s clear between that man And our current, ridiculous chump. It s clear that Trump s sole policies Are physical walls and hate; Barriers between and in His own and neighbouring states. We used to think this world was kind And large enough for all To live and share its pleasures, but Today we all want walls. But me, I want Obama back, Or Hillary, or else Just anyone who ll not destroy The kindness in our selves.
