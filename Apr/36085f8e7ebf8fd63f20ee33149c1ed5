EAC Secretary-General Liberat Mfumukeko has submitted a budget of $113.8 million for the financial year starting July. This is 12 per cent above the $101.4 million in the current year. Although there is no increase in individual partner states contribution, the total contribution from member states is expected to increase because of subscriptions from South Sudan when it joins the EAC as a full member in July. Each partner state's contribution to the EAC main budget for the financial year 2017/2018 is $8.4 million. In the 2016/2017 budget, South Sudan contributed $6.7 million, which according to the EAC ministers shall be considered as a supplementary budget. South Sudan is expected to adhere to principles of good governance, democracy, the rule of law and observance of human rights and social justice. The country has struggled with all these issues since the outbreak of the war in December 2013. South Sudan provides a huge market and Kenya and Uganda have more than quadrupled their exports in goods and services to the country in the past 10 years. Trade statistics show that Uganda exports goods and services worth over $200 million while Kenya exports over $180 million annually to South Sudan.
