Kenya's First Lady Margaret Kenyatta Wednesday at State House hosted her Ugandan counterpart Janet Museveni during a courtesy call. Mrs Museveni was returning home from a ministerial conference in Arusha, Tanzania Mrs Museveni also doubles as the Ugandan Education and Sports minister. Prolonged drought The two first ladies discussed several issues including the prolonged drought that has resulted in food challenges in both countries. They also discussed the recent Cross Country sporting events in Uganda where Kenya dominated other East African countries. Mrs Museveni, however, said the drought in her country was not as severe as in Kenya where it has affected 23 counties, 13 of them severely, leaving over 3 million people in dire need of food and water. Mutual programmes She said Uganda was experiencing some rains and only a few regions still faced food shortages. Mrs Museveni said she would find time in the near future so that they (the two first ladies) can discuss their mutual programmes. The Kenyan First Lady told the visitor she was currently focused on the Beyond Zero initiative that puts special attention on the health of mothers and children.
