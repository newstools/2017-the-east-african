The bear run at the Nairobi Securities Exchange has visited yet more pain on market participants, with stockbrokers and investment banks sinking into losses, leaving only a handful posting reduced profits during 2016. The net earnings of 14 market intermediaries that have so far released their results for 2016 show a negative return of $431,000 compared with $4.8 million in 2015. There are 22 companies involved in stockbroking and investment banking on the NSE. The depressed performance has eroded shareholder value and put hundreds of jobs in stock brokerage firms and investment banks at risk. While listed firms and investors are hurting from millions of dollars worth of capital losses due to the continued fall in share prices at the exchange, brokers and investment bankers who rely mostly on consultancy fees and commission income from trading in shares and bonds, are not doing any better. In a booming market, investment bankers diversify their income sources by providing advisory services in major transactions such as initial public offerings (IPOs), rights issues, and mergers and acquisitions. Capital, IPO But last year no company raised capital on the exchange through an IPO. Nairobi Business Ventures (NBV), for example, listed by way of introduction on the Growth Enterprise Market Segment (GEMS) at an offer price of Ksh5 ($0.05) per share. During 2016, the bourse attracted only two companies to raise additional capital through rights issues but one of them failed to raise the targeted amount. Longhorn Publishers issued 126 million additional shares to the existing shareholders at an offer price of Ksh 4.2 ($0.04) and raised Ksh533 million ($5.3 million). The issue was oversubscribed by one per cent. The Kenya Electricity Generating company (KenGen) on the other hand issued 4.4 billion additional shares at a price of Ksh6.55 ($0.06) per share and raised Ksh28.79 billion ($287.9 million), failing to meet the target by eight per cent. It was not any easier for stock brokerage firms and investment banks that bought shares in the NSE itself during its IPO and subsequent self-listing in 2014. NSE, which is self-listed as a company limited by shares, saw its net profit for the year decline by 40 per cent, from Ksh305.65 million ($3.05 million) in 2015 to Ksh183.95 million ($1.83 million) due to a decline in equity trading volumes. Shareholders earnings per share (EPS) fell from Ksh1.18 ($0.01) to Ksh0.71 ($0.007) in the same period. NSE share The NSE share declined 40 per cent from a high of Ksh24.75 ($0.24) per share in December 2015 to Ksh14.65 ($0.14) per share in December 2016, prompting stock brokers and investment banks to record revaluation losses on their books.
