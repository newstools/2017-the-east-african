Kenya's electoral commission chairman Wafula Chebukati said Wednesday that he could not guarantee the credibility of October 26 repeat presidential election. Mr Chebukati, addressing the media hours after IEBC commissioner Roselyn Akombe resigned, said it would be difficult to assure that the fresh poll would be free and fair, citing current conditions and divisions with the commission. The Supreme Court on September 1 nullified the August 8 Uhuru Kenyatta's re-election citing irregularities and illegalities, and ordered a fresh poll in 60 days. Since then, President Kenyatta's main challenger Raila Odinga has withdrawn, demanding a new poll 90 days after fresh nominations, and his National Super Alliance (Nasa) has resorted to demos to demand for electoral reforms before any election can take place. The protests and anger against the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission have taken the shape of some electoral officials being forcibly removed from training sessions in Nasa strongholds. The push-and-pull, with an IEBC that is heavily divided along the political lines, came to its climax Wednesday morning when Dr Akombe fled Kenya and announced her resignation from New York. Mr Chebukati also asked IEBC staff adversely mentioned in poll irregularities to step down and allow a special project team to manage repeat election.
