When Kenyan palaeoanthropologist Isaiah Nengo received a grant from the Leakey Foundation to carry out field studies in northern Kenya’s Turkana basin, few scientists wanted to join him in the harsh, sweltering landscape. Nevertheless, he and a small team of local researchers went to Napudet, where they discovered a 13-million-year-old skull of an infant ape. It was the most complete ancient ape skull ever to be found. “You find lots of bits and pieces, but never anything so amazing or spectacular,” said Dr Nengo. John Ekusi, one of the fossil finders from the Turkana Basin Institute (TBI), had wandered off to smoke a cigarette when he saw something in the ground that he thought was an elephant bone. Dr Nengo knew right away that it belonged to an ancient ape. With dental picks and brushes, the team carefully dug out the fossil. The skull was about the size of a tennis ball, meaning it belonged to a juvenile animal, but more tests had to be done to identify the type of ape. The find happened in September 2014, but the discovery was officially published in August in the science journal Nature. Napudet, on the western side of Lake Turkana, is now a dry stony area. However, during the Miocene period between five and 23 million years ago, the Turkana basin was a tropical forest with several animals. “The only reason why this specimen was so well preserved is that there was a huge volcanic eruption that blanketed the whole area,” said Dr Nengo, who obtained his PhD in Biological Anthropology from Harvard University.   He is currently a professor and associate director with Stony Brook University of New York state, which is affiliated to TBI.

This area of Napudet has previously yielded fossilised tree trunks dating to the same period, so Dr Nengo suspected there were more ancient remains to be found. Rock specimens taken from the site were measured in a laboratory at Rutgers University of New Jersey, US, and were dated to about 13 million years ago, giving the age of the fossil. Further high intensity X-ray scanning carried out at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility in Grenoble, France, revealed the brain cavity and teeth embedded inside the skull. From the teeth, they were able to gauge the exact age of the ape — 485 days. At first, it was thought that the animal was similar to gibbons, small apes
