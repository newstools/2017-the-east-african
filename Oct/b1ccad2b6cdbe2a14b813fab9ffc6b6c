East Africa has geographically been an important bird area since it lies on the migratory path — Africa-Eurasia flyaway system — of some of the world’s unique bird species. Recent studies however show that in the past two decades in Kenya and Uganda, the population of the Grey Crowned Crane has dropped by 80 per cent with their nesting sites most affected by human-wildlife conflict. The birds are spending more time looking out for human and livestock encroachment instead of tending to their eggs and chicks. This has translated into high mortality rate of crane chicks and subsequently a drop in the population of mature birds. Cranes, like many other aquatic species, are indicators of the state of the environment. When we stop seeing cranes, it will mean that there are no more wetlands, an ecosystem crucial to the survival of the birds and to some extent humans too as an important source of freshwater.   Kenya In Kenya, Lake Ol Bolossat, a pretty little lake on the foothills of the Aberdare Ranges in central Kenya, is home to about 900 Grey Crowned Cranes, and is listed as an Important Bird Area (IBA). To date, there are over 12,000 IBAs worldwide, selected using an internationally agreed set of criteria by BirdLife International based on their importance for the conservation of bird populations. Until recently, this quaint lake has been an important breeding ground for the Grey Crowned Cranes in Kenya. During the breeding season, between July and February, hundreds of cranes flock here and put on a spectacular display of courtship dances. But recent monitoring by the Nyahururu Bird Club/Cranes Conservation Volunteers, founded by local conservationist George Ndung’u, tells a different story. Out of the population of about 900 birds that flocked to the lake, only two chicks were hatched and fledged in the past two breeding seasons — between December 2015 and February 2017. Researchers are not in agreement over the numbers. Kerryn Morrison of International Crane Foundation/Endangered Wildlife Trust partnership based in South Africa, who has been studying cranes for more than two decades, says, “The difference in flock size this year [down by 76] may well not be a real decline. It may be that part of the flock is somewhere else and may return next year. Cranes do not always flock to the same area every year. Often we see a big flock split up and smaller flocks are then found at several sites.” Ndung’u concurs. “The fact is that we know very little about our cranes in Kenya.”
