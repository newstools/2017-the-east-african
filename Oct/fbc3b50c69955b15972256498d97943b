Rwandan government has banned the export of unprocessed milk, following reports of unregulated milk flows from the country to the Democratic Republic of Congo, as the problems between producers and processors escalate. The Ministry of Agriculture and Animal Resources (Minagri) issued a directive barring farmers and informal milk dealers from selling across the borders. “No raw milk should be exported any more, and all milk for export should be from recognised dairies,” the directive read. The order directly affects Rubavu, Rutsiro, Nyabihu and Ngororero districts, all from the Western Province and bordering DR Congo. All milk dealers and transporters are now supposed to form co-operatives to boost milk collection and transportation. Anyone transporting milk will also be required to have a certificate of origin issued by a milk collection centre. The certificate will show the full names of the milk transporter and destination, test results of the quantity and quality of the milk, as well as the full names and signature of the quality control technician. The directive comes at the height of a clash between farmers and processors over milk standards. Farmers who report high rejection rates have found a more predictable market in the DR Congo, thus starving local processors of supply. Statistics from Minagri show that between 30,000 litres and 35,000 litres of raw milk cross the Rwanda-DR Congo border daily, creating a serious shortage for Rwandan milk processors. “Mukamira Dairy, with a daily processing capacity of 80,000 litres, has recently been getting only 10,000 litres of raw milk a day,” said Michel Ngarambe, the head of Milk Produce in Minagri.
