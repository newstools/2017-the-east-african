A Kenyan court has ruled that the process that led to the appointment of constituency returning officers and their deputies is illegal. High Court Judge George Odunga on Wednesday found that the electoral commission IEBC did not follow the law while appoint the election officials. However, the judge declined to quash the gazette notice on the appointment of the poll managers. The case was filed by Mr Khelef Khalifa, the director at Muslim for Human Rights, who is also part of the team seeking to stop the Thursday repeat presidential election at the Supreme Court.
