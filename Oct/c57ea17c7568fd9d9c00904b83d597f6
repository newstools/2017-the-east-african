Sudan expects the United States to lift economic sanctions as Khartoum has met all the required conditions, a Sudanese minister said on Wednesday, days before Washington is due to announce a decision. According to the UK-based Financial Times, Sudan said it had also severed diplomatic relations with North Korea in fulfilment of Washington's conditions. The US government has said it is deciding whether to lift a raft of penalties imposed first over Khartoum’s perceived support of global terrorism, later its violent suppression of rebels in Darfur. Former US President Barack Obama temporarily eased some of the sanctions that have effectively cut Khartoum off from large parts of the global financial system. Officials said the gesture was meant to recognise Khartoum’s moves to end conflicts and its help in the war on terrorism. In July, US President Donald Trump’s administration postponed for three months a decision on whether to remove the restrictions full-time - giving it an October 12 deadline to make up its mind.
