Experts have urged African governments to use local arbitration centres to save the continent millions of dollars spent in cases filed abroad. The arbitration experts were meeting in Kigali for the East Africa International Arbitration Conference, whose theme was Linkages between International Arbitration and Africa’s Economy. The conference was held on September 28 and 29. “More than 95 per cent of all African cases are taken to arbitration centers outside the continent, and this is money getting out of local economies,” said Thierry Ngoga Gakuba, one the participants. According to the experts, it is difficult to calculate how much money African countries and companies on the continent spend on arbitration because of the confidential nature of the cases, but they estimate that it could be millions of dollars every year. “When a dispute arises on a contract entered into in Africa, concerning a project on the continent, and the matter is taken to Europe or Asia for arbitration, the parties spend money there instead of keeping it here in Africa,” said Fidel Masengo, the executive director of the Kigali International Arbitration Centre (KIAC). The conference discussed the economic potential of international arbitration for African economies by developing settlement mechanisms in the continent.

An example is the East African Court of Justice, which is an affordable arbitration centre but people have remained reluctant to refer their disputes to the court despite the court conforming to international commercial arbitration practices. Even the EAC partner states are yet to take up the free services offered by the Court. They find it easier to go to France, London or
