Two university workers were killed on Tuesday morning when unknown gunmen opened fire on a vehicle they were riding in coastal Kwale County. Two police officers and a driver were also injured in the attack. “A bus carrying students of TUM (the Technical University of Mombasa) was ferrying them from their hostels to the campus in Ukunda for classes and was being escorted by a van that had some staff of the college and two escort police officers,” a police official who spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity said. “Armed men numbering about 10 emerged from the bushes and started firing at the van in front. As a result two ladies who are staff of TUM were killed in the van. The driver of the van and two police officers were injured,” he said. Regional police chief Larry Kieng said the wounded have been taken to hospital. He said an investigation was under way and that Islamic militants were among the suspects. A month ago suspected Islamic militants attacked a church in the area killing two police officers and stealing their rifles.   Conservationists say construction defied a court order halting the project. Regional bloc says its ready for action as reports of ceasefire violations rise.
