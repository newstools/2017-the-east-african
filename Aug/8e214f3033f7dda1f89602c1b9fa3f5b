President Yoweri Museveni has appointed Justice Owinyi Dollo as Uganda’s new deputy Chief Justice ending the tenure of controversial ridden reign of Justice Steven Kavuma. Justice Stephen Kavuma who at one time was both deputy chief Justice and acting Chief Justice has retired upon reaching the mandatory retirement age of 70. In a letter to the Speaker of Parliament dated August 18th, President Museveni wrote; “In the exercise of powers vested in the President by Article 142 (1) of the 1995 Constitution and, I have, acting on the advice of  the Judicial Service Commission, appointed persons listed below as deputy Chief Justice and Justices of the Supreme Court.” The other two Justices elevated from High Court to the Supreme Court are Richard Butera, a former DPP and Paul Mugamba who formerly headed the Anti-Corruption Division of the High Court.   Controversial career With retirement looming, Justice Kavuma wrote to the Judicial Service Commission (JSC) seeking to review his age claiming he was younger than the official record stated. As deputy Chief Justice and the head of the Court of Appeal, Justice Kavuma sparked controversy as the “injunctions” judge overruling mandates in politically charged cases mainly against opposition politicians. His most controversial ruling revolves around the impeachment of Kampala Lord Mayor Erias Lukwago. Critics, the opposition politicians accused Mr Kavuma of bending rules to serve the interest of the government and the ruling President Museveni.
