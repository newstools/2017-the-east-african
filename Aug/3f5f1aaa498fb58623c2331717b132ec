A court in Uganda is expected to sentence six suspects today (Tuesday) on terrorism charges. The suspects are among 14 people arrested during investigations into the killing of Muslim clerics in 2014. The court has however not linked them to the murder of the Muslim leaders. The head of Uganda's Shia community, Sheikh Abdu Kadir Muwaya, was among those killed. He was shot dead on Christmas Day in 2014. Three days later Sheikh Mustafa Bahiga, a leader of the Tabliq sect, was also shot dead. ALSO READ:   Conservationists say construction defied a court order halting the project.
