IEBC Commissioner Yakub Guliye, who chairs the commission’s ICT committee, told the press that the system is intact and nobody had gained access despite the attempts. Form 34C is also the one that IEBC will use to declare the results, which by law should done by August 15, or seven days from the date of the elections. The validation and publishing of the official presidential results started on Wednesday at the Bomas of Kenya auditorium as IEBC moved to restore confidence in the exercise . Kenya's electoral commission IEBC Wednesday night confirmed that there were attempts to hack into their result transmission system but the attempt did not go through. IEBC Commissioner Yakub Guliye, who chairs the commission’s ICT committee, told the press that the system is intact and nobody had gained access despite the attempts. “We have seen attempts by some people to hack into our system but they did not succeed because we have invested heavily in surveillance system,” Prof Guliye said. “There was attempt but there is no evidence of access. The alleged hacking is not our system. Claims the system was hacked are not true.” Prof Guliye assertion seemed to depart from a clarification the commission’s CEO Ezra Chiloba had delivered earlier in the evening during another press briefing. Mr Chiloba had categorically stated that the system was safe and secure, and that there had been no attempt to hack into it.
