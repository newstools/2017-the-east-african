"As a commission we shall come up with a methodology to verify the allegations made on hacking," IEBC chairman Wafula Chebukati said in a briefing early Wednesday afternoon. While rejecting the results of the election, Nasa claimed that the the electoral commission's IT system has been hacked. Mr Odinga alleged that the hackers used the identity of the late IEBC ICT manager Chris Msando to log into the system and manipulate the polls results in favour of the ruling Jubilee Party. "We are telling our people not to accept results, stay calm as we get deep into this," Mr Odinga told a press conference earlier Wednesday.
