South African retail chain Shoprite will now be the anchor tenant at Kampala's prime shopping mall Acacia, where cash-strapped Nakumatt occupied. This comes two months after the Kenyan retailer announced closure of its major outlets at Acacia Mall-Kololo, Village Mall-Bugolobi and Victoria Mall-Entebbe. According to a statement issued Thursday by Knight Frank Uganda, the property manager, Shoprite Group is set to open its third store in the country at Acacia Mall.
