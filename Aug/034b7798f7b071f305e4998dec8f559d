South Africa's longest serving Cabinet member, Jeff Radebe, has said he is ready to serve as the president of the ruling African National Congress (ANC) party. Mr Radebe, who is the currently the Minister in the Presidency and ANC head of policy, is the latest member to join in the fray of those seeking to lead the party come December. “I'm a servant of the people…I'm prepared to serve the people‚” Mr Radebe said, responding to a question regarding the ANC presidential election. He was giving a Nelson Mandela lecture in Pretoria on Monday evening. Last month, his name had been proposed by the ANC Midvaal Zone in Gauteng, but he did not indicated whether he would contest until Monday. Mr Radebe joins other ANC stalwarts in the presidential contest including deputy president Cyril Ramaphosa, former African Union Commission chairperson Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, Parliament Speaker Baleka Mbete, and Human Settlements Minister Lindiwe Sisulu. The party will elect President Jacob Zuma’s successor during its national conference in December when the South African leader is expected to step down after serving his allocated two terms. He is expected to remain the country’s president until elections in 2019. Mr Radebe has served as a minister under all post-apartheid presidents since 1994.
