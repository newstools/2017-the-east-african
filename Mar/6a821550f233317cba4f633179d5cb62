President Uhuru Kenyatta Thursday officially received his Somalia counterpart Mohamed Abdullahi Farmaajo on the latter's first state visit to Kenya, according him full honours including a 21-gun salute. The visiting Head of State inspected his first guard of honour at State House in Nairobi, mounted by a detachment of the Kenya Army while the national anthems of Kenya and Somalia were played by the military band. The two leaders will be holding bilateral talks aimed at bolstering co-operation between Kenya and Somalia. President Kenyatta is expected to impress on the need to reinvigorate efforts to scale up collaboration in mutual areas of interest identified during the inaugural session of the Joint Commission for Co-operation that was held in Nairobi in July 2015. These areas include security, trade and investment, civil aviation, education, agriculture, resource-sharing and development, livestock development, fisheries, tourism, immigration, labour and health. Last month, President Kenyatta attended the inauguration of President Farmaajo in Mogadishu and pledged Kenya’s continued support to the Horn of Africa country. The Kenyan leader assured the new president that his country would remain steadfast in supporting efforts that would bring peace and stability in Somalia.
