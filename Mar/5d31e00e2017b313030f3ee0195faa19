Kenya s schools are full of kids Who seem to hate each other. They bully and they batter those Who re new to school, and younger. Schools we d though were excellent Seem really rather poor; The staff stand back while bullies reign. Show both these groups the door, For no-one stuck in boarding school Through endless days and nights Should have to suffer cowards who Believe they have the right To victimise their juniors Who REALLY have more rights To live in school contentedly, To study day and night. The worst of adults grow this way, As bullies who at school Are left to do their stupid acts; Suspend these Prefect fools!
