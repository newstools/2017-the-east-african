Zambia has opened public discussions on whether to leave the International Criminal Court (ICC). "The Ministry of Justice has launched the consultative process on Zambia's position on the country's membership to the ICC," state TV reported. The consultations, to be conducted in 30 districts, will start Monday, March 27, 2017, it said. The influence for Zambia to leave ICC could be coming from "outside" as the country had no formidable reason to campaign for its departure, analysts say. They believe the process was being politically driven. African leaders have often accused the ICC of targeting them unfairly, hence pushing for a mass withdrawal. The African Union backed the push for a collective withdrawal but the decision, taken by African leaders during a closed door session at an AU summit in Ethiopia, was not legally binding. The debate on the ICC was hugely divisive on the question of whether this should be individual or collective withdrawal. The continent has 34 signatories to the Rome Statute, the treaty which set up the court. Burundi, South Africa and The Gambia applied to leave the court - but the case for the latter two seems to have hit a brick wall. In the Gambian, new President Adama Barrow said he would reverse the decision by his predecessor Yahya Jammeh. A High Court in Pretoria recently revoked the South African government's decision to pull out of ICC. The court ruled that government's notice of withdrawal was unconstitutional and invalid.
