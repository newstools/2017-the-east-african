Trade disputes and mistrust among member states threaten to scuttle efforts to integrate the East African Community into a single economic and political bloc. Hardline positions taken by the member states on various issues affecting the region has watered down provisions in the Treaty, which provides for peaceful settlement of disputes. Chapter six of the EAC Treaty lays down the fundamental principles designed to govern the achievement of the goals of the regional bloc by partner states. These include mutual trust, political will and sovereign equality. Others are peaceful co-existence and good neighbourliness, peaceful settlement of disputes, and equitable distribution of benefits. The EastAfrican reviewed major trade deals that have caused friction among EAC partner states while threatening the stability of the bloc. While EAC Common Market Protocol liberalised the movement of labour in the region and set December 31, 2015 as the deadline for the partners states to waive permit fees, only Kenya, Uganda and Rwanda have complied. Tanzania and Burundi still require work permits for which all non-nationals have to pay fees, contrary to the protocol.
