Kenyan telecom giant Safaricom has announced a 9.5 per cent increase in its after-tax profit to Ksh26.2 billion ($253 million) for the six months ended September 30. Safaricom chief financial officer Sateesh Kamath, sitting in for CEO Bob Collymore who has taken sick leave, says the performance is backed by a strong performance in mobile money M-Pesa and data while traditional services like voice remained resilient.

Voice revenue, which is still the telco’s biggest income stream, grew from Ksh45.7 billion ($440 million) to Ksh47.35 billion ($457 million). “M-Pesa and mobile data are becoming the engines of growth,” said Mr Kamath at a media briefing in Nairobi Friday morning. Bob's health Chairman Nicholas Ng'ang'a urged an end to speculation over Mr Collymore's health, whom he said went for specialised medical attention abroad on the advice of his doctors. Mr Ng'ang'a said Collymore's absence for "a few months" leaves no vacuum at the company. “Bob’s style of management is very strong, he's empowered managers adequately hence as far as the company itself is concerned it's in strong hands. There is no vacuum," said Mr Ng'ang'a. READ: Corporate world rallies around ailing Safaricom boss Reporting by Brian Ngugi.
