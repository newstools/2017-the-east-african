This year’s finals of the Break-Fast Jam, an annual breakdance event held in Kampala, Uganda, will take place on November 18–1 9 at the YMCA in Wandegeya, Kampala. The competition brings together participants from East Africa and around the world to cultivate a breakdance culture in Africa. This year’s event will be hosted by the internationally acclaimed Belfast-born DJ Snuff, and will be graced by Danish dancer SoonEnough. DJ Snuff, who has collaborated with the Break-Fast Jam before, has also performed and toured the world with the likes of Snoop Dogg and Public Enemy. Dancers will compete in group and individual battles; others will showcase breakdance, popping, locking, new style, house dance, krumping, rap, beatboxing (vocal percussion) and deejaying. This year’s event will also feature graffiti art displays, music performances, a panel discussion, as well as a photography exhibition. For those seeking intellectual engagement on dance, there will be workshops. For fun lovers there will be street wear markets, food and drinks. The entrance fee is Ushs10,000 ($2.7) for adults but is free for children 10 years and below. Break-Fast Jam has been known to launch the careers of dancers and offer practical skills, knowledge and inspiration to those wishing to pursue dance as a profession.
