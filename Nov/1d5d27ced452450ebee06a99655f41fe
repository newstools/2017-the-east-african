Kenya's opposition National Super Alliance (Nasa) resistance movement wing has called on its supporters to shun services and products from telecom service provider Safaricom, milk processor Brookside and fast goods manufacturer Bidco Kenya. The political coalition says the boycott is an act of economic sabotage against corporates they claim are affiliated to the ruling Jubilee administration. “This is the beginning of the liberation of our country against corporates that have gone to bed with the Jubilee regime...The companies have denied Kenyans their right to participate in democratic elections,” Suna East MP Junet Mohamed told journalists at Okoa Kenya's Nairobi office Friday. The MPs asked Nasa supporters to start migrating to other firms with immediate effect, arguing that there were many alternative products and services. “The economy is already on its knees under the jubilee administration, therefore there is no price that is too high to pay for democracy,” Mr Mohamed added. Nasa accuses Safaricom of aiding rigging of August poll in favour of President Kenyatta, a claim the firm has denied and dismissed. The Raila Odinga-led coalition, on the other hand, accuses Brookside and Bidco of funding President Kenyatta’s Jubilee Party. On the eve of the October 26 repeat presidential polls, Nasa leader Raila Odinga said the coalition would be making public the names of corporations whose products his supporters should boycott. Mr Odinga said that the names will be released on a weekly basis in a national campaign of defiance against an “illegitimate governmental authority and non-cooperation with all its organs”.
