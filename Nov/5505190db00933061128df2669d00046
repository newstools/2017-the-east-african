US Deputy Secretary of State John Sullivan arrived Thursday in Sudan for a two-day visit to push for human rights and religious freedom, weeks after Washington ended sanctions against Khartoum. Sullivan is the highest ranking official from US President Donald Trump's administration to visit Khartoum since the trade embargo was lifted on October 12.
