Vulnerable areas The plan includes the deployment of personnel to the frontline in the affected districts, disinfection and fight against insects, cleaning up of vulnerable areas and for the purchase of fuel for ambulances. A Malagasy delegation headed by the Finances and Budget minister, Ms Vonintsalama Andriambololona, had appealed for further financial support to combat the epidemic. “We are pleased that the Bank has listened to our call. The ministry promises to closely supervise the good management of such resources in order to quickly tame the epidemic,” Ms Andriambololona said on Monday. The WB country manager in Antananarivo, Ms Coralie Gevers, assured that the new financial support would not affect the availability of other funds for Madagascar's social and infrastructure projects.
