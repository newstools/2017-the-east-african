There were mixed reactions in various parts of Kenya on Monday after the Supreme Court upheld the declaration of President Uhuru Kenyatta as the winner of the October 26 repeat election. A man was shot dead in the western Migori town, a telecoms service provider Safaricom booster vandalised and two vehicles set ablaze in Kisumu as residents protested the Supreme Court ruling. Ruling Jubilee supporters took to the streets to celebrate the judgement. Life went on as usual in some areas, with no protests or celebrations being witnessed. In many towns of Kiambu County, where Mr Kenyatta hails from, residents took to the streets to celebrate the apex court’s decision. They praised the judges, saying they had saved the country from sliding into anarchy. It was song, dance and ululations along the busy Thika highway in the city as Mr Kenyatta’s supporters came out to celebrate as soon as the court delivered its decision. The celebrations started from Githurai (about 18km from the city) with Jubilee supporters dancing their way to the city centre.
