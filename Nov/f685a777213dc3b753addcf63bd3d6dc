Rwandan government critic, Diane Shima Rwigara, and her mother will continue to stay in detention after an appeal hearing at the Kigali High Court failed to take off. The disqualified presidential aspirant and her mother Adeline Rwigara, are seeking to have a court ruling denying them bail overturned. They had been remanded for at least 30 days before the trial in which they are charged with public insurrection begins. Diane is also accused of forging signatures, while her mother of promoting sectarian practices. The three-judge bench adjourned the appeal hearing to Thursday November 16 after Diane’s lawyer, Celestine Buhuru, and her mother failed to show up. Mr Buhuru was reported to have excused himself to attend to another trial. Mrs Rwigara was said to have written to court saying she had fallen ill and could not come attend the hearing. The 35-year-old accountant and vocal critic of President Paul Kagame arrived in court Tuesday dressed in the pink prison uniform. She smiled and waved to a handful of relatives who included her sister Anne Rwigara who had been granted bail. The three women were arrested on September 25. They deny the charges against them saying they were “politically motivated” and aimed at silencing Diane’s criticism.Diane faces five to seven years in jail if found guilty of forgery and up to 15 years for inciting insurrection. Promoting sectarian practices attracts up to 5- to 7-year prison term.   Pair to remain in detention pending case hearing Conservationists say construction defied a court order halting the project.
