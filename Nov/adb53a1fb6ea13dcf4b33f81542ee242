South Africa’s ruling African National Congress (ANC) has distanced itself from the Zimbabwe crisis, saying it will not get involved in the rift. Zimbabwe remains in a state of political uncertainty, with the army denying staging a coup, but confirming pursuing what it calls 'criminals' around President Robert Mugabe. ANC Secretary-General Gwede Mantashe said that the party will not meddle in Zimbabwe’s affairs at this stage. “Zanu-PF must deal with that issue because Zimbabwe is not our colony, it’s not our province, it’s our neighbour. If things go wrong there, of course, we’ll be concerned because it’ll impact on us, but we have no authority over them, that’s the point we’re making,” Mr Mantashe said. The South Africa government said it was closely monitoring the situation, both as a neighbour and in its capacity as “chair of the SADC [Southern African Development Community] region”. The head of public policy at the Department of International Relations and Cooperation (Dirco), Mr Clayson Monyela, said they were in touch with the Zimbabwean government. The South African government also advised its citizens in Zimbabwe to maintain regular contact with the embassy in Harare. “There hasn’t been any violent incidents‚ as far as we are aware‚ so we wouldn’t discourage anybody from travelling to Zimbabwe‚” added Mr Monyela. The military issued a statement on Wednesday morning on national television saying President Mugabe was safe. The move came after President Mugabe fired his deputy, Mr Emmerson Mnangagwa, accusing him of being disloyal. The sacking was widely seen as a boost for President Mugabe’s wife, Grace, to take over as Zimbabwe’s next president.   Prolonged gunfire was heard near Mugabe's private residence. Conservationists say construction defied a court order halting the project. Regional bloc says its ready for action as reports of ceasefire violations rise.
