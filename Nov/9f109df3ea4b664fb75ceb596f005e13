Namibia will soon become a visa-free country after the government revealed plans to scrap visa requirements for African passport holders. The Cabinet last week approved the introduction of a visa-on-arrival policy as a first step towards abolishing the pre-entry pass. The southern African country will join a dozen African countries that offer liberal access (visa-free or visa-on-arrival) to Africans. The continental bloc, African Union, has set a 2018 deadline for the removal of visa requirements for all African citizens in all African countries. Namibia has however not indicated when it expects to have attained the visa-free status. African leaders are expected to approve for adoption a draft treaty establishing free movement around the continent at the AU Heads of State summit in January next year.
