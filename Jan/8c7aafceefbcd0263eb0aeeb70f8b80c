Global chief executives are more confident about the economy and the near-term prospects for their companies than they were a year ago, although the impact of recent political upheavals tops their list of longer-term concerns. A PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) survey of nearly 1,400 CEOs released on Monday, on the eve of the annual World Economic Forum in Davos, found that 29 per cent expected global economic growth to pick up in 2017, up from only 27 per cent last year. The survey found 38 per cent were very confident they could increase revenue growth in the next year, up from 35 per cent at the same time last year, which was a six-year low. Last year's outlook was particularly gloomy due to two years of falling oil prices and slowing growth in China, as well as uncertainty about the next US president, Bob Moritz, PwC's global chairman, told Reuters. Although Donald Trump's election is a dramatic shift, some bosses expect business-friendly policies like corporate tax cuts and lighter-touch regulation, and are more optimistic about their own ability to navigate the immediate unknown. "They are more concerned about more things, as the world has become more complicated. The risks that they are worried about are longer-term risks," Moritz said, adding that the survey only reflected the next 12 months, which is too soon to feel the full implications of a Trump presidency or "Brexit". The International Monetary Fund on Monday lifted its forecast for US economic growth in 2017 and 2018 based on President-elect Donald Trump's tax cut and spending plans, but said this would largely be offset by weaker growth in several key emerging markets. Updating its World Economic Outlook, the IMF kept its overall global growth forecasts unchanged from October at 3.4 per cent for 2017 and 3.6 per cent for 2018, up from 3.1 per cent growth in 2016, the weakest year since the 2008-2009 financial crisis. Brexit bump Adding to the rising confidence in the short term is evidence of the resiliency of the business environment in Britain after its vote last year to leave the European Union. The British pound is down about 19 per cent against the US dollar, giving a boost to domestic industries as imported goods have become more expensive and exports cheaper. British manufacturing grew at its fastest pace in two and a half years last month, adding to signs that the economy ended 2016 strongly. Even though economists expect some inflation in prices in Britain this year to make up for the higher costs, which could pressure budgets, PwC said 41 per cent of British bosses were very confident of their revenue growth in the near term.
