Rwandan President Paul Kagame has signed several agreements with Zambia where he arrived on Monday for a two-day state visit. The agreements include one on extradition. In the past, the Rwandan government has accused Zambia of harbouring genocide suspects, allegations Lusaka denies. In 2013, hundreds of Rwandan refugees leaving in Zambia turned down an offer by their government to grant them passports for purposes of repatriation. They said the move would expose them to Rwanda security agents. President Kagame called on his compatriots to return home. "Rwanda President Paul Kagame has thanked Zambians for accommodating his fellow countrymen who fled that country in the aftermath of the 1994 Rwandan genocide," reported state radio. State media further reported that ministers from the two countries signed agreements on air services, defence and security. Speaking when he hosted President Kagame and his delegation at State House in Lusaka, President Edgar Lungu said Zambia and Rwanda should explore areas of cooperation for their mutual benefit. But Zambia will continue with its policy of non-interference in affairs of other countries, he said.
