A large police presence held back angry crowds outside a Kensington church where Theresa May was meeting victims of the Grenfell Tower disaster. The British prime minister faced cries of "coward" and "shame on you". One woman wept, saying it was because the PM declined to speak to anyone outside the meeting which lasted less than hour. Mrs May pledged Â£5m of support, housing guarantees and help with access to bank accounts and cash. "The package of support I'm announcing today is to give the victims the immediate support they need to care for themselves and for loved ones. We will continue to look at what more needs to be done," Mrs May said in a statement issued by her office. Dozens of demonstrators surged towards the entrance of St Clement's church and there were scuffles outside as organisers appealed for calm. Earlier on Friday, the prime minister spent almost an hour speaking to patients and staff at London's Chelsea and Westminster Hospital. It came a day after she faced criticism for meeting firefighters but not residents at the scene of the blaze. She also chaired the government's Civil Contingencies Committee, which deals with major crises such as terrorism or natural disasters, in Whitehall.
