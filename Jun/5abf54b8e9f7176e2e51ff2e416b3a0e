RwandAir will begin non-stop flights to the Belgium capital from next month, the airline has said. The Rwandan flag carrier said it will fly its Airbus A330 planes three times a week from Kigali to Brussels directly from July 14, with a layover in London on the return flights. Chance Ndagano, the RwandAir's acting chief executive officer, said the new route is part of the airline's expansion efforts. “Adding Brussels to our fast growing network, reaffirms our commitment to create new opportunities for both continents with smooth connections from cities with high demand,” he said. Mr Ndagano took over the management of the airline two months ago after the CEO John Mirenge, who had been at the helm since 2010, was fired.
