My father was the eldest of 10 siblings. He taught me that to be successful I had to work hard. Brilliance on its own is not enough. He also taught me to maintain a good reputation. It is easy to lose your reputation, and difficult to get back. What values would you want to pass on to your children? The younger generation is in a hurry to make money and be successful. I advise my children to be patient, and to build a strong foundation for a successful life, marriage and business. Marriage can be difficult in the beginning, but with time you learn to respect each other. I also tell them that money isn’t everything. They need to build strong relationships and maintain them. These people can support you when you need them. The third thing I emphasise is that they should take responsibility for their lives, and give back to society. Eventually it comes back. What books are you reading? Currently I am reading Unafraid, by Kennedy and Jessica Odede. They are both New York Times best-selling authors, and the founders of Shofco (Shining Hope for Communities) in Kibera. I have also read all the books by John Grisham. I read some Indian authors to connect with that side of my heritage. Sometimes I wonder what life would have been like if we were still in India. What do you like to watch on TV? I am a big sports fan. I support the English football team Manchester United, and try not to miss any of their games. Sometimes I watch the series with my wife. I also enjoy watching golf, which I play. What’s your golf handicap? I am now playing off 22, but at one point I had gone up to 13. But I got busy and stopped playing for some time. What is your best destination yet in East Africa? The Maasai Mara. This is the place where I can just switch off and relax. What is the one piece of technology that you cannot live without? My mobile phone. Although I am not completely attached to it and I switch it off at night. What do you consider your greatest achievement? That would be my family. I have great relationships with my children. What’s your biggest regret? Some family relationships have broken down, and that is quite sad. What advice would you give to other family-owned businesses? You need to identify individual strengths and use them appropriately. Not everyone is good at business. What’s your favourite food? I travel a lot and enjoy cuisines from all over the world. But my favourite meal is home-cooked chicken curry. You lived in Portugal for a while. What was that like? The people are very friendly and they have great food and wine. And, my wife is from there.   Conservationists say construction defied a court order halting the project. Regional bloc says its ready for action as reports of ceasefire violations rise.
