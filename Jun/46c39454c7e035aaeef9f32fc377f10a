Tanzania has registered a $636.7 million surplus balance of payments for the year to April 2017, even as its exports and imports dropped. According to the Bank of Tanzania, there was a significant recovery after the country experienced a deficit of $183.9 million in the same period in 2016. The Bank’s monthly economic review said that the surplus resulted from the current account, which narrowed by half to a deficit of $1.6 billion due to a fall in imports. In addition, the deficit in the current account dropped by 50.1 per cent from a level of $2.4 billion recorded in April 2016 to $ 1.6 billion this year, largely driven by a decline in the value and cost of imported goods. “Although exports also declined, the impact was more than offset by imports. In the year ending April 2017, with the exception of food and foodstuff, all categories of goods imports declined,” said the report. The annual import bill decreased to $7.8 billion in April 2017 from the $9.3 billion recorded in the year ending April 2016.

According to the report the import bill for oil declined by 17 per cent to $1.9 billion as a result of a fall in oil prices in the world market. Generally, the prices of oil in the world market went down by $13.8 to $561.2 per tonne, from $575 million per metric tonne in the year ending April 2016. In addition to oil imports, transport equipment, other consumer goods, building and construction materials and machinery importation dropped.
