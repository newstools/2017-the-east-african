Ethiopian Airlines has placed an order for 10 Airbus A350-900 passenger jets, it said on Tuesday, in addition to at least another 10 it already has on order. Separately, Boeing and Bombardier said the airline had also ordered aircraft from them. The A350-900s will be deployed on Ethiopian's long haul routes connecting Addis Ababa with destinations in Africa, Europe, the Middle East and Asia, Chief Executive Tewolde GebreMariam said in a statement. The state-owned carrier is ranked the largest in Africa by revenue and profit by the International Air Transport Association (IATA), the global industry body.
