A conservationist who played a key role in reintroducing the eastern black rhino to Rwanda has been killed by one of the animals, a wildlife group says. African Parks has reported Krisztián Gyöngyi, a Hungarian was killed while tracking the animals in the Akagera National Park. The report did not give more details, but rhinos usually charge and kill people with their horn. Eastern black rhinos became extinct in Rwanda about a decade ago, and were reintroduced in May. African Parks brought 20 rhinos from South Africa to the Akagera National Park.

Mr Gyöngyi was a rhino specialist with more than five years' experience, and was instrumental in supporting efforts to reintroduce the black rhino to Rwanda, Mr Fearnhead added. In the 1970s, more than 50 black rhinos lived in the Akagera National Park, but their numbers fell as a result of wide-scale poaching. The last confirmed sighting of the species was in 2007 until African Parks reintroduced them in May after taking steps to improve security at the reserve.   Throughout years of ups and downs, hardships and golden years, Akagera’s future has never looked so bright. Conservationists say construction defied a court order halting the project.
