June marked 50 years of the illegal Israeli occupation of Palestinian territories. In December last year, the United Nations Security Council (yet again!) called for settlement construction to end in the illegally occupied Palestinian territories. In March this year, the UN Human Rights Council called on member states to distinguish between Israel proper and Palestinian territories and regulate trade in settlement goods and products. It has also called on the UN’s High Commission for Human Rights to begin a database on companies from and operating in illegally occupied Palestinian territories. This January’s African Union summit went further in its standing position in support of Palestine. It called (yet again!) for full Israeli withdrawal from all Palestinian territories and rejected all settlements under the illegal occupation. It called on the international community to pressurise Israel to stop all settlement activity and, specifically, for all states not to move their diplomatic missions from Tel Aviv in Israel proper to Jerusalem. It also called on African member states to boycott all settlement goods and products. But international and regional condemnation of the illegal occupation and settlement activity is no longer enough. The ascent to power of Donald Trump in the United States, his altogether too cosy relationship with Israel and his own disregard for international law on this issue, has clearly breathed new life into Israel’s own disregard for international law. There is now open talk of the complete annexation of the West Bank by Israel. The weighting of the facts tells the discriminatory story. Over 1,000 Palestinian complaints about torture with not a single criminal investigation. As compared with 99 per cent of all cases against Palestinians in Israeli military courts ending in convictions. Over the past three decades, over 10,200 Palestinians in illegally occupied territories have been killed as compared with 1,400 Israelis. Civil and political rights violations are not the worst of it. The illegal occupation continues to have devastating impacts on Palestinians’ economic, social and cultural rights. Rights to a livelihood and work. To access and benefit from their own land and the resources therein, including, something as simple and yet as necessary as their water.International and regional condemnation is not enough. For all of these reasons, to mark 50 years of the illegal occupation, Amnesty International this past week launched a one-year global campaign. The campaign demands that all states live up to their international obligations by doing two simple things: First, effecting a national ban on the imports of settlement goods and products. And second, preventing their own companies from trading in settlement goods and products and operating in the illegally occupied Palestinian territories. Amnesty International-Kenya will be following up with the government of Kenya on these calls  which are fully in line with the Common African Position. Kenya too, despite its long history of engagement with Israel, must live up to its international obligations. L.
