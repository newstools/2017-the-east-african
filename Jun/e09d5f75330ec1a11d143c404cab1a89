Researchers from global banking institutions have expressed concern that the pre-election splurging spree and heavy infrastructure spending to win over voters will damage Kenya s economic growth prospects. About 19 million registered voters go to the polls on August 8 to elect new leaders against a backdrop of economic challenges. On the one hand, some government data paints a picture of a vibrant economy grown from 4.7 per cent in 2013 to 5.8 per cent in 2016, anchored by massive infrastructure development. Other data shows that over two million small-sized firms have closed shop over the past five years, public debt has risen to Ksh4 trillion ($40 billion) while inflation is pushing double-digit figures. Several corporates have either shut down and relocated from the country or scaled down operations, leaving thousands of workers jobless. These include tyre maker Sameer Africa, dry cell manufacturer Eveready East Africa, chocolate maker Cadbury Kenya, Procter &amp; Gamble, Reckitt Benckiser, Colgate Palmolive Bridgestone, Unilever and Johnson &amp; Johnson, Softa Bottling Company and Kenya Fluorspar Company.

Overall month-on-month inflation for May increased to 11.7 per cent from 11.48 per cent in April and 10.28 per cent in March compared with 3.67 per cent in 2013. As we highlighted last month, the recovery in business conditions could prove to be transitory due to a cocktail of dangerous headwinds, said Jibran Qureshi, an economist at CfC-Stanbic Bank. Researchers at Citigroup said all infrastructure spending is not equally beneficial as governments are often tempted to support projects for electoral rather than economic motives. Inefficiency and corruption are more likely when projects are ultimately funded by the central government or through foreign aid but implemented and managed by state and local governments, the researchers say. Several economists and credit rating agencies have reduced their growth forecasts for Kenya in 2017.
