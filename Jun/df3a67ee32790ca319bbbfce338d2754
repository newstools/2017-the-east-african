Dar es Salaam has protested Nairobi’s refusal to lift a ban on cooking gas imports through the Kenya-Tanzania border. Tanzania said it learnt about the restriction through the Kenyan media and contacted Nairobi to explain why it took such a decision. The Permanent Secretary at the Industry and Trade ministry, Prof Adolf Mkenda, said Kenya’s stance undermines East African Community trade rules as well as an agreement reached between the two governments to resolve the stalemate. Prof Mkenda said the issue was discussed at length during the East African Community Sectoral Council on Trade, Industry, Finance and Investment meeting in Arusha on June 2. “During the meeting, Kenya agreed to lift the ban on cooking gas imports from Tanzania with immediate effect,” he said in a statement released Wednesday. However, Kenya continues to bar cooking gas imports that do not enter the country through the Port of Mombasa, he added. He said the move is affecting businesspersons in Tanzania who have been trading with Kenyans.
