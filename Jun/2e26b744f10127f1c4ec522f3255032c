Somalia's militant Islamist group al-Shabaab says it has carried out a major assault on a military base in the semi-autonomous region of Puntland. Its fighters killed 61 government troops and seized 16 vehicles in the dawn raid, the group said. A Puntland government minister has denied the high death toll, but did not give separate casualty figures. The al-Qaeda-linked group has carried out several big attacks on military bases in Somalia. In January, it said it had killed 50 Kenyan soldiers in an assault on their base in Kulbiyow town in the south of the country. Kenyan troops are part of an 18,000-strong African Union (AU) force helping the UN-backed government tackle al-Shabaab in Somalia.
