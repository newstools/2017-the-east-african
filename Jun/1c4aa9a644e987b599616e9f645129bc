Tanzania President John Magufuli has directed the Industry and Trade minister, Charles Mwijage, to repossess former government factories that had been sold to investors but are now closed. The president said the government erred in the past by selling these plants to individuals "who are not bothered" and now 197 factories lie in ruin. Magufuli was speaking during a three-day tour of the coastal region where he commissioned seven factories. He called on investors who have failed to develop the factories to return them to government. Magufuli further told the minister to order the arrest of those who resist, saying "once they leave jail they will find the factory already in operation." Under a five-year development plan 2016-2020, the Magufuli administration has set a target for speeding up industrialisation to make each of Tanzaniaâ€™s 26 regions attract manufacturing industries and agro-processing factories.   Conservationists say construction defied a court order halting the project. Regional bloc says its ready for action as reports of ceasefire violations rise.
